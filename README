THIS PROJECT HELPS RUN SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON EMOJIS. EMOJIS HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE AFINN_LIST AND THEY ARE WEIGHTED. THE WEIGHTS WILL OVER-RIDE THE THE WORDS. SO
IF THERE IS A TWEET THAT SAYS 'GO TRUMP <THUMBS DOWN>, THE THUMBS DOWN WILL OVER-RIDE THE POSITIVE 'GO', MAKING THE TWEET 'NEGATIVE'.
THERE ARE MANY NEUTRAL EMOJIS, LIKE FLAGS, FOOD AND PLACE SYMBOLS. THEY ARE WEIGHTED == 0
